# Training-Set-Optimisation-for-Epitope-Prediction
This repository contains the code, datasets, and models for my Master's project on optimizing the training set for epitope prediction.  The project's main objective is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of epitope prediction, which is crucial for diagnostics, vaccine development and immunotherapy research.
